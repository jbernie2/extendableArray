 extendableArray.java
  functionally equivalent to an ArrayList, but with different
  internal mechanisms for allowing for unlimited array space.
  
  this implementation uses a two dimensional array where each
  array row increases in size by a power when an element is 
  inserted into the array, the index is hashed into the first array
  by finding the log based 2 value, the element is then positioned
  into the second array by subtracting the lowest index value in 
  that specific array from the index given by the user.

 Performance:
  The performance advantage that this structure has over the ArrayList
  is that the entire array does not have to be copied over everytime 
  the array is expanded. However, there is more overhead for each operation,
  but all operations should occur in roughly the same amount of time. where 
  as with an ArrayList some operations may take much longer

 Time Complexity:
  access time O(1)
  placement time O(1)

 Space Complexty:
  2^(Ceiling (log(array size)based 2))
